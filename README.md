# Ternary clock (trcl)

This is a macOS app which displays current time in several timezones of your choosing:

The idea is to give the user time in other region at a shortest glance without having to constantly make the calculations. 

I needed this because my partners are in California, my wife works with a company headquartered in Boston and we're currently living in Moscow, Russia — so I was really tired of time arithmetics. 

There are all non-fractional time offsets at your disposal, along with 12/24 hours clock setting for local time:

To install the app please download the latest build from [releases section](https://github.com/kzkv/trcl/releases), unpack it and move to Applications folder.

For the trcl being launched on the user log in, please add it to System Preferences → Users & Groups → your user → Login Items. I'd also suggest switching system clock display to analog, if you have one.
